- Creates user profiles for webapps that do not exist
- Window is repositioned approx. 5px right and 20px south of the last saved position
- Requires a basic Mozilla profile template to be copied in place to avoid Firefox-esque messages etc
- Needs a simple context menu and menu bar (for now)
- Start building Debian packages for the application
- Seperate the webapps from the build, these should be individual Debian packages
